/*The main point of the question is to find the day where a higher temperature than the present one and how many days to get that day.
  It is similar to the next greater element question.
           step 1 : create a stack for storing the intermediate result.
           step 2 : now, iterate the list from backsie.
           step 3 : pop from the stack if the top element is less than the present value.
                    next,if stack is not empty that means we got temperature greater than present temperaure so store the value.
                    else stack is empty means no temperature greater than present temperature.
                    finally,push the present element.
           step 4 : return the answer */
